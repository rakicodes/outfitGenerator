A simple outfit generator inspired from the movie Clueless. You can pick your top and bottom and the generator will tell you if the two are a match.

## How It's Made
Technologies used: HTML5, CSS3, Javascript

My main focus for this project was to learn how to manipulate the DOM with Javascript by displaying and hiding the various images.

## Optimizations
Currently only works well with desktop. Further optimizations and media queries are needed to make the site responsive to various devices.
